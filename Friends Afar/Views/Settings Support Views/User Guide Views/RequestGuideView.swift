Be careful, though - if you switch tabs while you have text in the text field, it will disappear! Also keep in mind that if someone has blocked you, they will not see any Feelings submitted by you. Furthermore, if you include explicit language, a user with the profanity filter enabled may not see your Feeling. Futhermore, if you upload a blank Feeling, no user will receive it.")
